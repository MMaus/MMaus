- 👋 Hi, I’m Moritz (@MMaus)
- 👀 I’m interested in current techniques in full stack development, as well as ML.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Spring, PHP & Vue.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ML learning projects, but please note that I'm a beginner on that topic.
  Actually, I have a pretty clear idea on an ML project which I want to start when I got my current projects
  to some clean stage, which I'm happy to share with interested persons!
- 📫 How to reach me - by mail: h.moritz.maus@gmail.com
